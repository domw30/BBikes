## Boris Bikes Project

Writing an app that will emulate a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. The program will model docking stations, bikes and the infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to run a Boris bike style business.

### Motivation

This project is being conducted as part of the Makers Academy course. The aim of the project is to develop skills in the areas of TDD, learn new techniques for debugging and to improve familiarity with the Ruby coding language.

## Approach

```
As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working
```
